# SNN_Arduino
Currently, you can make spiking neurons that accept external analog and asynchronous digital inputs. At the netwok level, it allows you to create arbitrary network motifs of up to 6 neurons with digital sensors interfaced to the network. The ability to handle analog inputs at the network level will be added soon.

You can easily interface the 'motor' neurons of your network to L293D ICs and other actuation to create a neural robot!

Go through the currently uploaded examples for an idea of how to use the library effectively.
